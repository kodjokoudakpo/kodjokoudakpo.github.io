 <p> <a> Fiscal Rules and Fiscal Policy: A Quantitative Analysis </a> [<a href= "/assets/pdf/Kodjo_Koudakpo_FRFP_JMP.pdf"> Job Market Paper </a>]</p>
<p align="justify"> This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the optimal design of deficit limits
under imperfect enforcement. Utilizing data on primary balances and fiscal
rules from 2000 to 2021, I document two critical patterns in low-income countries :
the persistence of primary deficits and frequent instances of noncompliance with
fiscal rules. To elucidate the role of noncompliance in shaping optimal deficit limits,
I employ a tractable fiscal policy model to conduct a quantitative exercise. The
model incorporates a key assumption that the cost of noncompliance with a deficit
limit rises as borrowing increases. Analytical results demonstrate that the optimal
deficit limit is determined by the magnitude of sanctions associated with violations
of fiscal rules. Calibration for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies suggests that
an optimal deficit limit ranges from 5.12% to 9.5% of GDP, while the sanctions
vary between 0.33% and 2.7% of GDP. These findings contribute to the broader
discourse on the reform of fiscal rules in SSA countries, offering evidence-based insights
into the trade-offs between fiscal flexibility and the enforcement of compliance
mechanisms. </p>
